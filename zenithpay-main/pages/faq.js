                Bitcoin is trusted widely because itâ€™s open-source and
                decentralized. This means that the global public has access to
                the entire Bitcoin source code at any time. All payments can be
                made without reliance on a third-party and the whole system is
                protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms and
                most important thing is no institution or organization can
                control Bitcoin.
